description: 'A compact, reusable LinkML schema for sleep research common data elements
  (CDEs). Designed to support cross-dataset harmonization by separating measurement
  semantics from acquisition/scoring protocol modifiers. Target: 40-120 canonical
  CDEs organized into ~20 concept groups, with explicit modifier axes for sleep stage,
  body position, respiratory event definitions, and PSG type.'
